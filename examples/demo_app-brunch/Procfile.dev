# Note: we are using `npm run` rather than `bin/yarn` because yarn does not wait
# does not forward the SIGTERM signal to its children before exiting:
#   https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/4667
# which can end up leaving orphaned processes.

gulp:    npm run watch:gulp
webpack: npm run watch:webpack
